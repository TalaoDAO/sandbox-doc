Getting started
===============


Wallet
------

To set your Decentralized Identity, you first need to use the AltMe wallet which supports Identity and Tezos crypto features. Go to `Apple store <https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/altme/id1633216869>`_ or `Google store <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.altme.alt.me.altme>`_ to get the app installed on your smartphone.

You can create a wallet as a crypto wallet setup with a new passphrase or new addresses or you can create a wallet through a passphrase import from Temple, Kukai or any other Tezos compliant wallet.
If you do so you should see all your cryptos and NFTs as any standard crypto wallet. Altme supports Beacon as well so you can transfer them or play with them.

After having installed and setup your wallet, do "Add cards" to get an Email proof. Then go to https://talao.co and sign up to open an account.
