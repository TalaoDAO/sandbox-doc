Quick start
===========

We are now going to create our first verifier.

Download the mobile Wallet from Apple or Google store
------------------------------------------------------

To set your Decentralized Identity, you first need to use the AltMe wallet which supports Identity and Tezos crypto features. At the end of this process you will have your own Decentralized Identity (DID).

 1) Go to `Apple store <https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/altme/id1633216869>`_ or `Google store <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.altme.alt.me.altme>`_ to get the app installed on your smartphone.
 2) Launch teh app, you can create a wallet as a crypto wallet setup with a new passphrase or new addresses or you can create a wallet through a passphrase import from Temple, Kukai or any other Tezos compliant wallet. If you do so you should see all your cryptos and NFTs as any standard crypto wallet. Altme supports Beacon as well so you can transfer them or play with them.
 3) After having installed and setup your wallet, on the Discover screen click to get an Email Proof blue card.
 4) Enter your email, enter the secret code received in your email box and download you Email Proof VC. 

You have now recieved your first VC and you can also check your DID in the menu Settings/Show Decentralized ID. It starts with "did:key".
